# Concurrent Programming, Project 1

`MojaPlansza` is a synchronized implementation of the `Plansza` interface,
allowing for synchronized placement, movement, and removal of `Postać` objects,
as well as synchronized performance of `Akcja` actions on `Postać` objects on
the board.

## Testing

Unit tests for each helper object are found in `testy/<object name>Tests.java`.

Extended functional of the full `MojaPlansza` implementation can be found in
`testy/Testy.java`.
